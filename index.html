    <h1>Why you should join Team Power!!!</h1>
    <h2>1. GANONDORF</h2>
    <p>The mascot for team power during the splatfest is ganondorf, aka the best character.  Not only is he the hottest out of all of them, but he absolutely has the coolest design out of everybody to ever exist and I would let him take me over with his power.  If somebody says that they don't like ganondorf (sexually or as a character), they are a liar and are too afraid to speak the truth.</p>

    <h2>2. WISDOM IS FOR NERDS!!!</h2>
    <p>You might hear some MFs arguing that WISDOM is the best option to choose because that way you will know how to use your power, but who cares about knowing how to use your power? What is the point of wisdom?! Oh great... you know stuff.  What are you going to do with that worthless knowledge huh?? I'll tell you what, without power, you can't do NOTHING with it.  Sure, you might be able to find the cosine of 98 degrees if you go with team wisdom, but unlike wisdom, team power will actually be USEFUL in the long run.  If anybody says they are on team power, just imagine that they look like this:</p>

    <h2>3. COURAGE IS UNNECESSARY</h2>
    <p>While courage might be seen as the next best choice and is much more respectable than wisdom is, it is also useless when power is an option.  If you have tons of power, why would you be afraid of doing things, thats right, you wouldn't be.  Power is quite literally just courage, but you also get the ability to do the things that you want with the courage.  If you are still not corageous after choosing power, then I'm sorry, but you are just a coward</p>
